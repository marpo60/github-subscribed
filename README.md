## Features
* Works out of the box

## How does it work? 

* When visiting a subscribed thread it will automatically start tracking that thread.
* It attaches to the subscribe button so all new subscribed threads will be tracked.

## What about my old subscriptions, are they added automatically?

They are not... for now.
